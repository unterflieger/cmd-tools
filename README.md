**How to import plugins**

*SyncTerm*

	For SyncTerm (https://github.com/bbs-io/syncterm-windows/releases), you need to copy all the files from  
	the SyncTerm directory and copy them into another 
	folder named "syncterm" in the "addons" directory.
	The plugin/software will be detected automatically.

*Youtube-DL*

	For Youtube-DL (https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/releases) it's possible to 
	copy the executable into the addon folder.
